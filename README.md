## Overview

LeaveManagementT5 is a web application that caters to two distinct user perspectives. When logged in as an employee, users can only access and perform actions relevant to their role, such as viewing their own leave requests and submitting new leave requests. Administrators, on the other hand, enjoy expanded functionality, including the ability to manage all employees' leave requests, create new leave types, and control employee leave allocations.
